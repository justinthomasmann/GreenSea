When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data}
#import data file
df <- read.csv("GreenSeaTurtleInjuries2019_2023.csv", h=TRUE)

#what data class is injury nature (df$Nature)
class(df$Nature)

#make it a factor
df$Nature <- as.factor(df$Nature)

#use levels() to verify it's now a factor with 4 levels
levels(df$Nature)
```

```{r colorblind accessible pallet}
colorBlindPal  <- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", 
                       "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
```

```{r plotting}
InjuryNature.plot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(Nature))+
  geom_bar(fill = "#0072B2")
InjuryNature.plot
```
